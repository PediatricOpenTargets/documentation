## Datasets

**Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA):** In September of 2018, the Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) released the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (PBTA), a genomic dataset (whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, proteomic, and clinical data) for nearly 1,000 tumors, available from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Portal. The Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA) Project is a global open science initiative to comprehensively define the molecular landscape of tumors of 943 patients from the CBTN and the PNOC003 DIPG clinical trial from the Pediatric Pacific Neuro-oncology Consortium through real-time, collaborative analyses and collaborative manuscript writing on GitHub.

**Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET):** The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) Initiative is an NCI-funded collection of disease-specific projects that seeks to identify the genomic changes of pediatric cancers. 'The overall goal is to collect genomic data to accelerate the development of more effective therapies. OpenPedCan analyses include the seven diseases present in the TARGET dataset: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, Neuroblastoma, Osteosarcoma, Rhabdoid tumor, and Wilmâ€™s Tumor.

**Gabriella Miller Kids First Neuroblastoma (Kids First) The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First):** is a large-scale effort to accelerate research and gene discovery in pediatric cancers and structural birth defects. The program includes whole genome sequencing (WGS) from patients with pediatric cancers and structural birth defects and their families. OpenPedCan analyses include Neuroblastoma data from the Kids First project.

**The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx):** GTEx project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public data resource and tissue bank to study tissue-specific gene expression, regulation and their relationship with genetic variants. Samples were collected from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq. OpenPedCan project includes 17382 GTEx RNA-Seq samples from GTEx v8 release, which span across 31 GTEx groups in the v10 release.

**The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA):** TCGA is a landmark cancer genomics program that molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. It is a joint effort between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute. OpenPedCan project includes 10414 TCGA RNA-Seq samples (716 normal and 9698 tumor) from 33 cancer types in the v10 release.
